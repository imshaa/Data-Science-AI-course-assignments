# Assignment 3 – Data Visualization  
**Dataset:** `students.csv`

## Overview
This assignment focuses on exploring and visualizing data to better understand relationships and trends within the student dataset. Using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, multiple plots were created to analyze student performance and study patterns.  
**First Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) completed.**

## Steps Performed

### 1. Importing Libraries
- Used **pandas**, **matplotlib.pyplot**, and **seaborn** for data handling and visualization.

### 2. Loading Dataset
- Loaded the dataset using `pd.read_csv()` to prepare it for analysis.

### 3. Class Tasks – Basic Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Compared average grades by gender to observe performance differences.  
- **Scatter Plot:** Explored the relationship between study time and final grade (G3).  
- **Histogram:** Displayed the distribution of final grades to identify performance trends.  

These plots helped understand how gender and study time influence overall grades.

## Assignment Tasks – Advanced Visualizations
Created 5 additional plots for deeper insights:
- **Boxplot:** Showed the link between absences and higher education interest.  
- **Count Plot:** Compared mother’s education with student performance levels.  
- **Heatmap:** Displayed correlations between academic features like grades, absences, and study time.  
- **Pie Chart:** Visualized the percentage of students aiming for higher education.  
- **Line Graph:** Highlighted average grades across different study time levels.
