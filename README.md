# üéì Student Performance Prediction Project  
**Data Science Repository | Weeks 1‚Äì8**

---

## üìò Project Overview
This repository documents my complete Data Science learning and implementation journey over 8 weeks.  
The core focus of this project is **Student Performance Prediction** ‚Äî analyzing and predicting students‚Äô academic outcomes using **machine learning models**.

The dataset used (`students.csv`) contains various academic and personal attributes of students, such as grades, study time, failures, and absences.  
Through data cleaning, statistical analysis, model training, and evaluation, this project aims to understand what factors influence student performance and how predictive models can help forecast academic success.

## üéØ Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Explore, clean, and analyze real-world educational data.
- Build predictive models to identify key factors affecting student grades.
- Apply both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques.
- Develop a strong foundation for creating a fully functional **student performance prediction system**.

This end-to-end workflow demonstrates the complete data science process ‚Äî from **data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization**.

## üß† Dataset Description
**Dataset:** `students.csv`  
**Source:** Student performance dataset (UCI repository-based format)  
**Key Columns:**  
- `G1`, `G2`, `G3` ‚Äî Student grades in different terms  
- `studytime`, `absences`, `failures`, `freetime`, `famrel` ‚Äî Behavioral and social factors  

The dataset provides a strong foundation for analyzing how academic and lifestyle factors affect final results (`G3`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Progress & Workflow
Each week focuses on a core component of the data science pipeline. Together, they build toward a complete predictive system.

| **Week** | **Topic** | **Key Focus** |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **1‚Äì2** | Data Loading & EDA | Data cleaning, handling missing values, and initial exploration of relationships. |
| **3‚Äì4** | Statistics & Correlation | Understanding dataset behavior using mean, variance, correlation, and identifying top predictors for `G3`. |
| **5** | Regression Modeling | Building a **Linear Regression** model to predict the final grade (`G3`) using features like `G1`, `G2`, and `failures`. |
| **6** | Classification | Implemented **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression** to classify pass/fail outcomes. |
| **7** | Model Evaluation | Evaluated models using metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC Curve** to measure accuracy. |
| **8** | Unsupervised Learning | Applied **K-Means Clustering** and **PCA** to discover hidden patterns and group students by performance levels. |

## üìà Key Project Outcomes
- **Data Understanding:** Comprehensive EDA helped uncover patterns and correlations between study time, grades, and absences.  
- **Model Development:** Trained and evaluated multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression).  
- **Performance Analysis:** Used statistical and visual tools to assess model accuracy and reliability.  
- **Pattern Discovery:** Applied clustering to group students based on academic similarity and performance trends.  
- **Practical Insight:** Identified top features (G1, G2, studytime, failures) most influential in predicting final grades.

## üß© How These Steps Improved the Project
Each assignment contributed to building a **complete, structured machine learning pipeline**:
- Early weeks established **data understanding** and **feature selection**.  
- Mid-stage assignments built **predictive models** and improved their accuracy.  
- Later stages introduced **evaluation and clustering**, giving a deeper insight into student behavior.  

This progressive structure made the overall project more efficient, interpretable, and ready for future deployment or integration into a predictive dashboard.

## üöÄ Current Milestone (After Week 8)
After completing all 8 assignments:
- The dataset is **fully cleaned, analyzed, and standardized**.  
- Predictive and clustering models have been **successfully trained and evaluated**.  
- Key predictors for student success have been **identified and validated**.  
- The project is now positioned to move toward **model optimization**, **deployment**, or integration into a **Student Analytics Platform**.
